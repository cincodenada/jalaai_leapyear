This is a script I used to generate a better chart of the Jalaali leap year
than the [one that I found](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jalaalileap.gif)
on Wikipedia, which needed some help, but had no source data.

I know very little about the Jalaali calendar, so I based this script heavily
on information from [Kazimierz M. Borkowski's paper](http://www.astro.uni.torun.pl/~kb/Papers/EMP/PersianC-EMP.htm)
that I found online.  If I made any major errors, let me know!

I compiled the equinox dates from http://ns1763.ca/equinox/eqindex.html
